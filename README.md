# React-shop

This small application is my implementaion of the project from react training by [Mikhail Nepomnyashchiy](https://github.com/michey85) written by me to get some training of working with backend APIs as well as to get some React.js coding practice.

This application is online shop of fortnites allowing users to look at the goods list, flter them by categories, put them into shopping cart, remove and change the quantity as well as submit the order.

### Technical stack used for this project:

- React.js in combination with native JS
- CSS framework in combination with ownn stylesheet
- Create_React_App in combination with NPM for customization, building and deploying the project
- GIT and github/github pages

Most of CSS styles were taken from [materializeCSS library](https://materializecss.com/) with adding some particular own style if/as needed.

As backend application I've used free API [fortniteapi](https://fortniteapi.io/)

The page deployment may be seen by the following [link](https://nikolaykrishtopa.github.io/react-shop/).

If you'd like to contact me please refer to the following [link](mailto:nikolay.krishtopa@gmail.com). I would be glad to revieve any feedback or suggestions.

Thank you for viewing my project!
